0.9.2:
	in fact, Array and ArrayIterator have been removed now.

	pcre++ has now its own namespace: pcrepp.



0.9.1:
	typedef std::vector<std::string> Array;
	typedef std::vector<std::string>::iterator ArrayIterator;

	those two typedefs will be removed in version 0.9.3.

	please use std::vector<std::string> and std::vector<std::string>::iterator
	instead or define the typedef in your own sources.
