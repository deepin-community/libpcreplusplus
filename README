This is the source code for the C++ class library pcre++.
pcre++ is a wrapper class around the pcre library (Perl
Compatible Regular Expressions), which is available on
http://www.pcre.org/.

Compile and install it using the following commands:

% ./configure
% make
% su
# make install
# ^D
%

If you are having problems compiling pcre++, try suppliying
some flags to the configure script, for example the location
of the pcre library or it's headers. Try ./configure --help
for a summary of all available options.

The class documentation is available as unix manpage:

% man 3 Pcre

You might consider the HTML version of the documentation as
a good starting point too, just go to the directory doc/html/
underneath the src-directory and open index.html with your
favorite browser.

If you want to use this class library you have two choices:
Either you compile and install it as usual and link your
binary against it:

  g++ -c yoursource.c `pcre-config --cflags` `pcre++-config --cflags`
  g++ yoursource.o `pcre-config --libs` `pcre++-config --libs` -o yourprogram
